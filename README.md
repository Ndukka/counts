# counts
This will enable you to either add or multiply different numbers. 
I created this python code to work on multiplication and addition of different numbers, without having to define the + or * sign. 
For instance, say you want to add up or multiple 4 different numbers.  The code will ask you for the no. of numbers you wish to either add or multiply. 
So you input 4. 
Next, it will repeatedly ask for the numbers you wish to multiply, 4 different times. When you input those numbers. It will add/multiply them. 

Please note that this code does not work for subtraction or division.
